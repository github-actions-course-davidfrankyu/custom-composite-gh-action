# NOTES:
- when your job runs directly on a GH actions runner, the runner uses its own file system
- when your job runs in a container, the steps of the job run inside the container
- GH actions maps the working directory from the runner to the container, but the path is different
- consequently, actions are checked out to __w/_actions
